    "IMG-ID": "Mammogram_Lateral_View",
    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Heterogeneously dense",
    "BIRADS": "4B",
    "FINDINGS": "The mammogram shows a heterogeneously dense breast. There are areas of increased density noted in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. These areas do not have the typical spiculated appearance associated with malignancy but warrant further evaluation with additional imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI."
