I will provide you with a mammogram image. Your task is to analyze the image and extract key diagnostic information, including breast composition, BIRADS category, and any significant findings. Present the output in a structured JSON format with the following keys: IMG_ID, Breast_Composition, BIRADS, and Findings. Ensure the response is precise, medically relevant, and well-organized.
Please follow the below given JSON format for your response:
{
    "IMG-ID": "<Image_Filename>",
    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "<Description of breast tissue composition>",
    "BIRADS": "<BIRADS category; any values between 1 to 6. BI-RADS category is a standardized classification for breast imaging findings, ranging from 1 to 6, where: BI-RADS 1 indicates a negative result with no abnormalities; BI-RADS 2 signifies benign findings with no suspicion of cancer; BI-RADS 3 suggests a benign lesion, requiring short-term follow-up to confirm stability; BI-RADS 4 represents a suspicious abnormality needing biopsy, further divided into 4A (low suspicion), 4B (moderate suspicion), and 4C (high suspicion); BI-RADS 5 is highly suggestive of malignancy with a high probability of cancer; and BI-RADS 6 confirms a known malignancy with a biopsy-proven cancer diagnosis.",
    "FINDINGS": "<Summary of any abnormalities, calcifications, or other observations>"
}
