    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "ACR B (Scattered areas of fibroglandular density)",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "FINDINGS": "There are no suspicious findings in this mammogram image. The breast tissue appears to be composed mostly of fat with some scattered dense tissue, which is consistent with ACR B. However, the presence of a spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast suggests a high level of suspicion for malignancy. Further evaluation, such as biopsy, may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis."
