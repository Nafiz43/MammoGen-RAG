    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in the image appears to be dense, with a mix of glandular and fibrous tissue.",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "FINDINGS": "There are several areas of concern in this image. The most prominent finding is a mass located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This mass appears to be irregularly shaped and has an indistinct border, which suggests that it may be malignant. Additionally, there are several other areas of increased density throughout the breast, which could indicate the presence of additional masses or microcalcifications. These findings require further evaluation with biopsy."
