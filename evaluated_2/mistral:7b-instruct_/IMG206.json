    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this image appears to be heterogeneously dense, which means that it has a mix of both fatty and dense areas.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is an oval-shaped opacity with ill-defined margins and a speckled appearance in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion, possibly a fibroadenoma or a complex cyst. However, due to its indeterminate nature and the presence of some architectural distortion, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
