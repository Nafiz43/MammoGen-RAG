    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears to be heterogeneously dense.",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and a possible calcification present in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma or a benign calcification. However, due to the density of the breast tissue, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
