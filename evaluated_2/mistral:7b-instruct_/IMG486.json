    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this image appears to be heterogeneous, with areas of both fatty and dense tissue.",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity seen in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadena or a benign fat necrosis. However, due to its size and location, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
