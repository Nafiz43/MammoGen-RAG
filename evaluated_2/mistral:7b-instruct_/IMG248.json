    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears dense, with a heterogeneous distribution of glandular and fibroglandular tissues.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is an oval-shaped opacity seen in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This opacity measures approximately 10mm in diameter and has a well-circumscribed margin.
