    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears to be heterogeneously dense.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is an oval, circumscribed opacity with a smooth contour and regular margins, measuring approximately 10mm in diameter, located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma or a fat-containing hamartoma. However, due to the heterogeneously dense breast tissue, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
