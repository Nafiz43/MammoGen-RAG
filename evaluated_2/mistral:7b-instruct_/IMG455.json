    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears dense, with a heterogeneous distribution of glandular and fibroglandular tissues.",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is an oval-shaped opacity with ill-defined margins, measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion, possibly a fibroadenoma or a complex cyst. However, due to its indeterminate nature and size, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
