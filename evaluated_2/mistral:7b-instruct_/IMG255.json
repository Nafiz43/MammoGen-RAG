    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this image appears to be heterogeneous, exhibiting both dense glandular and fatty tissues.",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is a well-circumscribed, round mass lesion with regular margins, measuring approximately 1.2 cm in diameter, located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The density and shape of this lesion are suggestive of a benign fibroadenaoma. However, due to its size and location, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
