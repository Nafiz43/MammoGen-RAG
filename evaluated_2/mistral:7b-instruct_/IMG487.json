    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears to be heterogeneously dense.",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with a regular margin and a density slightly greater than the surrounding tissue. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma or a benign fat necrosis. However, due to the heterogeneously dense breast tissue, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
