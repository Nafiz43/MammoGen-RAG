    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "ACR B (Scattered areas of fibroglandular density)",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "FINDINGS": "The mammogram shows scattered areas of fibroglandular density. A well-defined circumscribed mass is observed in the upper outer quadrant, measuring approximately 1.2 cm. The mass has smooth borders and no spiculation or architectural distortion. Additionally, there are multiple small calcifications noted in the lower inner quadrant, which appear as fine granules. These findings suggest a moderate suspicion for malignancy and warrant further evaluation with additional imaging or biopsy."
