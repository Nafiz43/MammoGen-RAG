    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "No mass or calcifications are visible in this image. However, there is a small, round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and density slightly greater than the surrounding tissue, which may represent a benign finding such as a cyst or a benign solid lesion. Short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
