    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and a central lucency is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding is most likely a benign fibroadenoma or a benign fat necrosis. However, due to the density of the breast tissue, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
