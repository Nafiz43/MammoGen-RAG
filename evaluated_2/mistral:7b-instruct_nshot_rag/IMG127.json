    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "heterogeneously dense breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "There is an oval, circumscribed opacity with a well-defined margin in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The opacity measures approximately 10 mm in diameter and has a regular contour. No microcalcifications are seen around it. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma. Short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
