    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "Around 9 o'clock position, there is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and homogeneous density. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma. However, due to the dense breast tissue, it is recommended for short-term follow-up to confirm stability."
