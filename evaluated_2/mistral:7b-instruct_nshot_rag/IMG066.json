    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast tissue (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and regular contour is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. No calcifications are present within or around this lesion. This finding suggests a benign lesion, likely a fibroadenoma (BIRADS 3), requiring short-term follow-up to confirm stability."
