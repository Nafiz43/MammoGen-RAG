    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A small, round, circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and a central lucency is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding is suggestive of a benign fat necrosis or a benign cyst. However, due to the dense glandular tissue in this region, it is recommended for short-term follow-up to confirm stability."
