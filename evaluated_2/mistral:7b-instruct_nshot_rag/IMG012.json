    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "FINDINGS": "A round, circumscribed opacity with regular margins and a central lucency is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion, but due to the dense breast tissue (BI-RADS 4B), further evaluation with short-term follow-up or biopsy is recommended."
