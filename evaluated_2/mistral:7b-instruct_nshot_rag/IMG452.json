    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "predominantly dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "Around the periphery of the image, there are multiple round and oval calcifications with regular margins. No mass lesion is identified in this image. The nipple and skin appear normal. Given the presence of multiple benign-looking calcifications and no suspicious masses or architectural distortion, this finding is considered a benign finding requiring short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3)."
