    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "This image shows a heterogeneously dense breast with some areas of fatty replacement. There is an irregularly shaped, round mass lesion measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass has indistinct margins and is slightly heterogeneous in density. No calcifications are visible within or around the mass. Further imaging with MRI or biopsy is recommended to confirm the nature of this finding."
