    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "heterogeneously dense breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "FINDINGS": "Multiple round and oval shaped calcifications are seen scattered throughout the image, some of which exhibit a clustered pattern. No mass lesion is evident in this image. The breast tissue appears to have an irregular contour with some areas of increased density. These findings suggest a low suspicion (BI-RADS 4A) for malignancy."
