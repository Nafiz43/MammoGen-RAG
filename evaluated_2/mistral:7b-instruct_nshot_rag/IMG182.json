    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "Around 5 o'clock position, there is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and regular contour. This finding suggests a benign lesion. However, due to the dense breast tissue, it is recommended for short-term follow-up (BIRADS 3) to confirm stability."
