    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast tissue with scattered fibrotic areas (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "Around 1 o'clock position, there is a round, well-circumscribed opacity measuring approximately 8mm. The opacity shows mildly increased density compared to the surrounding tissue and has a regular contour. No microcalcifications are seen around this lesion. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma. Short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
