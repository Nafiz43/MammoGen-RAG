    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A small, round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and a smooth contour is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding is likely benign, but requires short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3). No other significant findings are noted."
