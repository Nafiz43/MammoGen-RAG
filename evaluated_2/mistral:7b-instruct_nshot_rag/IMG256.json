    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "Around 10 o'clock position, there is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and dense calcifications. This finding suggests a benign fibroadenoma. However, due to the density of the breast tissue, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
