    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast tissue (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "Around 2 o'clock position, there is a round opacity with well-circumscribed margin and no distortion of the surrounding tissue. This finding is suggestive of a benign cyst or a benign solid mass. However, due to the dense breast tissue, it is recommended for short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3)."
