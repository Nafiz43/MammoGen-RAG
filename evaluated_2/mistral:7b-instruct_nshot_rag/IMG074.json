    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and a central lucency is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion, likely a benign cyst or fibroadenoma. Short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
