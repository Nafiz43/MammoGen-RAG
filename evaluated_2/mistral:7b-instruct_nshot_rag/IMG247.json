    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "This image shows a heterogeneously dense breast tissue with some areas of fatty replacement. There is an irregularly shaped, round opacity with ill-defined margins in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The opacity measures approximately 10mm in diameter. No microcalcifications are seen around this lesion. This finding is suggestive of a benign lesion, possibly a fibroadenoma, and requires short-term follow-up to confirm stability."
