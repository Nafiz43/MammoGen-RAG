    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR C)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and regular contour is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma or other benign lesion. Short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability (BIRADS 3). No signs of skin thickening, nipple retraction, or calcifications are observed."
