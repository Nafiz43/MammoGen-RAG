    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and regular contour is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. No microcalcifications are present around this lesion. The lesion measures approximately 10 mm in diameter. This finding suggests a benign lesion that requires short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3)."
