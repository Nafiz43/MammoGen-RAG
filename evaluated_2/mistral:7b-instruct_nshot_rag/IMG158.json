    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Mixed density breast tissue (ACR B)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "Around 2 o'clock position, there is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with a smooth contour and dense calcifications. This finding suggests a benign lesion, possibly a fibroadenoma or a complex sclerosing adenoma. However, due to the presence of calcifications, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
