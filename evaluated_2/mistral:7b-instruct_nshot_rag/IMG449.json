    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "predominantly dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "4B",
    "FINDINGS": "Around the periphery of the image, there are multiple round and oval shaped calcifications with varying sizes. Some of these calcifications have a pleomorphic shape and are clustered together. There is also an irregularly shaped opacity with spiculated margins in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. These findings suggest a suspicious lesion (BIRADS 4B) requiring short-term follow-up to confirm stability."
