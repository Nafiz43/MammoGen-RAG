    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast parenchyma (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": "4B",
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with smooth margins and a central calcification is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding is suggestive of a benign calcified fibroadenoma (BI-RADS 3), but due to its location and size, short-term follow-up is recommended for confirmation of stability (BI-RADS 4B)."
