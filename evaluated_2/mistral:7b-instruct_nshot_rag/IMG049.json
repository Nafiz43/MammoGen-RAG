    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "heterogeneously dense breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins and a density similar to that of fat is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion, requiring short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3). No other significant findings are present."
