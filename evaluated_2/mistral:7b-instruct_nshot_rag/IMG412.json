    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Dense glandular breast tissue (ACR D).",
    "BIRADS": "3",
    "FINDINGS": "A well-circumscribed, round mass with a smooth contour and regular margins is seen in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. No calcifications are present around the mass. The mass measures approximately 1.2 cm in diameter. This finding suggests a benign lesion that requires short-term follow-up to confirm stability (BIRADS 3)."
