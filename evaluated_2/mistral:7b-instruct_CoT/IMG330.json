    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "This mammogram image shows a heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), indicating a significant amount of glandular tissue that can make it more challenging to detect abnormalities.",
    "BIRADS": "BI-RADS 3",
    "FINDINGS": "There are no clear signs of masses, calcifications, or architectural distortion in this image. However, due to the heterogeneously dense breast composition and the potential for small abnormalities being obscured, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
