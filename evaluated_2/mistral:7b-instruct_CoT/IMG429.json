    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "This mammogram image shows a heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), indicating a significant amount of glandular tissue that can make it more challenging to detect abnormalities.",
    "BIRADS": "BI-RADS 3",
    "FINDINGS": "The current mammogram image reveals no clear signs of calcifications, well-defined or spiculated masses, architectural distortion, or asymmetry. However, due to the heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), further imaging or biopsy may be required for a definitive diagnosis."
