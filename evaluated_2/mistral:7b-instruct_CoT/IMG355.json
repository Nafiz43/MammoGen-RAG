    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "This mammogram image shows a heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), indicating a significant amount of glandular tissue with some fatty areas.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There are no visible calcifications (CALC), well-defined masses (CIRC), spiculated masses (SPIC), or other ill-defined masses (MISC) in this image. However, there is a slight asymmetry between the right and left breasts, which may be due to normal variations or prior surgery. Further imaging with mammography or ultrasound and/or biopsy may be needed for confirmation."
