    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "This mammogram image shows a heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), indicating a significant amount of glandular tissue that can make it more challenging to detect abnormalities.",
    "BIRADS": "BI-RADS 3",
    "FINDINGS": "There are no clear signs of masses, calcifications, or architectural distortion in this image. However, due to the heterogeneously dense breast composition, it is recommended for short-term follow-up (BI-RADS 3) to confirm stability."
