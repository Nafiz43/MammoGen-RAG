    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "This mammogram image shows a heterogeneously dense breast composition (ACR C), indicating a significant amount of glandular tissue that can make it more challenging to detect abnormalities.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "The image reveals a well-circumscribed mass (CIRC) in the upper outer quadrant, which is typically benign. However, since this breast composition is heterogeneously dense, further imaging or biopsy may be required to confirm stability."
