    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "Predominantly dense breast parenchyma (ACR D)",
    "BIRADS": "4A",
    "FINDINGS": "Round, circumscribed opacity with regular margins and no calcifications. This finding is suggestive of a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma or a simple cyst. However, due to the dense breast tissue, further evaluation with short-term follow-up imaging or biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis."
