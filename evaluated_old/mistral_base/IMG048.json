    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears to be heterogeneous, exhibiting both dense and fatty areas.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins, measuring approximately 10mm in diameter, located in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding suggests a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma or a fat necrosis. However, due to its size and location, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
