    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this mammogram image appears dense, with a significant amount of glandular and fibroglandular tissue.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is an area of calcifications detected in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. These calcifications are round and clustered, suggesting a benign finding such as a benign calcification cluster or a benign fibroadenoma. However, due to their size and location, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
