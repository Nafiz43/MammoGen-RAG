    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this image appears to be heterogeneous, with areas of both dense glandular and fatty tissue.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity seen in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. This finding is suggestive of a benign fibroadenoma or other benign lesion. However, due to its location and size (approximately 1 cm), short-term follow-up imaging is recommended to confirm stability."
