    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in this image appears to be heterogeneous, exhibiting both dense glandular and fatty tissues.",
    "BIRADS": 3,
    "FINDINGS": "There is a round, well-circumscribed opacity with regular margins, measuring approximately 10mm in diameter. This finding suggests a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma or a fat necrosis. However, due to the heterogeneous breast composition and the size of this lesion, short-term follow-up is recommended to confirm stability."
