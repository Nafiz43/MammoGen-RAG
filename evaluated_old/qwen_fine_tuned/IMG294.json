    "IMG_ID": "IMG294",
    "Breast_Composition": "Heterogeneously dense,",
    "BIRADS": 4,
    "Findings": "The mammogram shows a heterogeneously dense breast. There are areas of increased density noted in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. These areas do not have the typical spiculated appearance seen in malignancies but warrant further evaluation with additional imaging such as ultrasound or MRI. The patient should be advised to undergo a biopsy if the area persists over time.\n}\n```"
