    "BREAST-COMPOSITION": "The breast tissue in the image appears to be dense, with a mix of glandular and fibrous tissue.",
    "BIRADS": "BI-RADS 4C",
    "FINDINGS": "There are several areas of concern in this image. The most prominent finding is a mass located in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. This mass appears to be irregularly shaped and has an indistinct border, which suggests that it may be malignant. Additionally, there are several small calcifications scattered throughout the breast tissue. These calcifications can sometimes be benign, but their presence in combination with the mass raises concerns about the possibility of cancer."
